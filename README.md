# WP Change Admin Email
== Description ==

The WP Change Admin Email plugin empowers administrators to modify the "site admin email" on their WordPress site without the necessity of sending a confirmation email from the server. This functionality proves invaluable in various scenarios, such as testing environments, localhost setups, or any situation where outbound email services are disabled. In WordPress 4.9 and later, a new constraint was introduced that restricts administrators from changing the site admin email without a functioning outbound email configuration. This plugin is designed to reinstate the administrator's ability to modify this setting without requiring a confirmation email. It's important to note that the "site admin email" is the global email address utilized for administrative purposes within the site. It serves as the "from" address when the site dispatches emails. This is distinct from the administrator's personal user email, which is associated with their user account.
